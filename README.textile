Paranoia.app is kind of example source project for using the new background location services in the upcoming iPhone OS 4.0 (beware breaking your NDA).

The example uses only significant location changes (= hand over to new cell towers) and sends them with a simple GET request to the internet.

You should alter the URL which will be called on a location change event. Since my code is quick and dirty 1 hour round up, you've to alter it on two occurences:
* in the app delegate and
* in the view controller

Yes, the UILabels in the xib file do not any useful things, as of now.
